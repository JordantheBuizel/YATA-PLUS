# YATA +
Yet Another Theme Application PLUS

This is a custom version of YATA made by me for me for myself and my friends, by adding features and fixing bugs it became a good application,
so when i saw that Reisyukaku decided to not update anymore the original application i decided to publish this one.
My goal is to create a complete solution for creating custom themes for 3ds.

Features added:
- "new" theme key in the File menu
- Loading uncompressed themes
- Auto open image in a photo editor
- Gui for a certain WAV -> CWAV converter
- Generating CWAV chunks (Replace SFX in the theme)
- Dumping and playing CWAVs
- User preferences
- Generating themes previews for CHMM

Known bugs fixed:
- Changing scroll types
- Other bugs relative to saving the theme (When writing a theme the offsets for images,colors etc weren't updated so sometimes the theme generated would be invalid)

Features to add:
- WAV to BCSTM converter (with loop support)
- WAV to CWAV without rerly on copyrighted software
- Theme simulator with every UI element
- *Other things*

Thanks to:
