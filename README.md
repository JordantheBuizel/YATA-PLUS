# YATA +
Yet Another Theme Application PLUS

This is a custom version of YATA made by me for me and my friends, by adding features and fixing bugs it became a good application,
so when i saw that Reisyukaku decided to not update anymore the original application i decided to publish this one.
My goal is to create a complete solution for creating custom themes for 3ds.
