# YATA +
Yet Another Theme Application PLUS

This is a custom version of YATA made by me for me for myself and my friends, by adding features and fixing bugs it became a good application,
so when i saw that Reisyukaku decided to not update anymore the original application i decided to publish this one.
My goal is to create a complete solution for creating custom themes for 3ds.

V1.2 relased, check other details on Gbatemp: https://gbatemp.net/threads/relase-yet-another-theme-application-plus-yata-3ds-theme-editor.393355/

- Xextil for the source of "Custom Theme Cwavs".
- HCS for vgmstream.
- NAudio Developers
- And everyone everyone who contributed indirectly fromGBAtemp and 3dbrew.org !!
